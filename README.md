# **Getting Started with Create React App**  

This project was initialized using **Create React App**.  

 **Available Scripts**  
In your project directory, you can run the following commands:  

**npm start**  
- Starts the app in development mode.  
- Open **http://localhost:3000** to view it in your browser.  
- The page automatically reloads when changes are made.  
- Lint errors may also appear in the console.  

**npm test**  
- Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
- For more details on running tests, refer to the documentation.  

**npm run build**  
- Builds the app for production and stores the output in the **build** folder.  
- Optimizes the build for the best performance by bundling React in production mode.  
- The build is minified, and filenames include hashes for cache management.  
- Your app will be ready for deployment.  

For more information on deployment, check the documentation.  

**npm run eject**  
⚠️ **Note:** Ejecting is a one-way operation!  

- If you need full control over the configuration, you can use **eject**.  
- This command removes the single build dependency from your project.  
- Copies all configuration files and dependencies (e.g., **webpack**, **Babel**, **ESLint**) directly into your project.  
- Other commands will continue to work but will now use the copied scripts.  

Most projects won't need to **eject**. The default setup is suitable for small to medium-sized deployments, but **eject** is available if you need advanced customization.
